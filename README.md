###Acer C7 Chromebook Resources

####a collection of my chrubuntu setup tools and configurations for the Acer c710-2847 of which I run 4 exclusively for literally everything, not necessarily by preference.

###Critical Acclaim (sort of):
<li>"Clearly you need to be in the market specifically for a cheap and smallish machine for day-to-day web surfing and <li>some light media consumption"
<li>"the downside is that battery life isn’t stellar. We can’t run our standard laptop-based tests on Chromebooks..."
"If you’re particularly precious about the number of keys you have under your fingertips, the size of your hard drive or the brightness of your screen - but aren’t concerned with what your laptop looks like - then by all means"
"If you only want to browse the web with your notebook, and that’s it, this machine will serve you well"
"Chromebooks are an oddity of the modern computing world"
"At $199, you get what you pay for..."
"you'll have to accept a lot of compromises"
